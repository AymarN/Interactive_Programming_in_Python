Practice Exercises for Mouse and List Methods 

Solve each of the practice exercises below. Each problem includes three CodeSkulptor links: one for a template that you should
use as a starting point for your solution, one to our solution to the exercise, and one to a tool that automatically checks your solution. 
1.	For each mouse click, print the position of the mouse click to the console. 

2.	Modify the program template below so that clicking inside any of the three displayed circles prints the color of the clicked circle 
to the console. Hint: Use the supplied function dist to compute the distance between the center of each circle and the mouse click. 

3.	Write a function day_to_number(day) that takes the supplied global list day_list and returns the position of the given day in that list.
You can either use the Docs to locate the appropriate list method or write a for loop to implement this function. 

4.	Write a function string_list_join(string_list) that takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string that is the 
concatenation of the strings in the list. We recommend using a for loop to implement this function.

5.	Complete the given program template to produce a program that fills the canvas with a 10x10 grid of touching balls of the given size. 
You should use two for loops, one nested inside the other, placed in the draw handler.

6.	Challenge: Write a program that draws a polyline (an open polygon) based on a sequence of mouse clicks. The first click should create
a point. Subsequent clicks should add a new segment to the polyline. You should include a “Clear” button that deletes the polyline and 
restarts the drawing process.
