Mini-project description - RiceRocks (Asteroids)
For our last mini project, we will complete the implementation of RiceRocks, an updated version of Asteroids, that we 
began last week. You may start with either your code or the program template which includes a full implementation of 
Spaceship and will be released immediately after the deadline for the Spaceship mini-project (by making the preceding
link live). If you start with your own code, you should add the splash screen image that you dismiss with a mouse 
click before starting this mini project. We strongly recommend using Chrome for this mini project since Chrome's 
superior performance will become apparent when your program attempts to draw dozens of sprites.

Mini-project development process
At the end of this project, your game will have multiple rocks and multiple missiles. You will lose a life if your ship
collides with a rock, and you will score points if your missile collides with a rock. You will keep track of the score 
and lives remaining and end the game at the proper time. You may optionally add animated explosions when there is a collision.

Phase one - Multiple rocks

For this phase, you will keep a set of rocks and spawn new rocks into this set. This requires the following steps:
1.	Remove a_rock and replace it with rock_group. Initialize the rock group to an empty set. Modify your rock spawner to create
a new rock (an instance of a Sprite object) and add it to rock_group.
2.	Modify your rock spawner to limit the total number of rocks in the game at any one time. We suggest you limit it to 12. With 
too many rocks the game becomes less fun and the animation slows down significantly.
3.	Create a helper function process_sprite_group. This function should take a set and a canvas and call the update and draw 
methods for each sprite in the group.
4.	Call the process_sprite_group function on rock_group in the draw handler.

Phase two - Collisions

For this phase, you will detect collisions between the ship and a rock. Upon a collision, the rock should be destroyed, and the 
player should lose a life. To implement ship-rock collisions, you need to do the following:
1.	Add a collide method to the Sprite class. This should take another_object as an argument and return True if there is a collision
or False otherwise. For now, this other object will always be your ship, but we want to be able to use this collide method to detect
collisions with missiles later, as well. Collisions can be detected using the radius of the two objects. This requires you to 
implement methods get_position and get_radius on both the Sprite and Ship classes.
2.	Implement a group_collide helper function. This function should take a set group and a sprite other_object and check for 
collisions between other_object and elements of the group. If there is a collision, the colliding object should be removed from the
group. To avoid removing an object from a set that you are iterating over (which can cause you a serious debugging headache), iterate
over a copy of the set created via set(group). This function should return True or False depending on whether there was a collision.
Be sure to use the collide method from part 1 on the sprites in the group to accomplish this task.

3.	In the draw handler, use the group_collide helper to determine if the ship hit any of the rocks. If so, decrease the number of 
lives by one. Note that you could have negative lives at this point. Do not worry about that yet.
At this point, you should have a game of "dodge 'em". You can fly around trying to avoid the rocks!

Phase three - Missiles

For this phase, you will keep a set of missiles and spawn new missiles into this set when firing using the space bar. This requires
the following steps:
1.	Remove a_missile and replace it with missile_group. Initialize the missile group to an empty set. Modify your shoot method of
my_ship to create a new missile (an instance of the Sprite class) and add it to the missile_group. If you use our code, the firing
sound should automatically play each time a missile is spawned.
2.	In the draw handler, use your helper function process_sprite_group to process missile_group. While you can now shoot multiple 
missiles, you will notice that they stick around forever. To fix this, we need to modify the Sprite class and the 
process_sprite_group function.
3.	In the update method of the Sprite class, increment the age of the sprite every time update is called. If the age is greater than
or equal to the lifespan of the sprite, then we want to remove it. So, return False (meaning we want to keep it) if the age is less
than the lifespan and True (meaning we want to remove it) otherwise.
4.	Modify process_sprite_group to check the return value of update for sprites. If it returns True, remove the sprite from the group.
Again, you will want to iterate over a copy of the sprite group in process_sprite_group to avoid deleting from the same set over which
you are iterating.

Phase four - Collisions revisited Now, we want to destroy rocks when they are hit by a missile. We can't quite use group_collide, 
because we want to check for collisions between two groups. All we need to do is add one more helper function:

1.	Implement a final helper function group_group_collide that takes two groups of objects as input. group_group_collide should iterate
through the elements of a copy of the first group using a for-loop and then call group_collide with each of these elements on the 
second group. group_group_collide should return the number of elements in the first group that collide with the second group as
well as delete these elements in the first group. You may find the discard method for sets to be helpful here.

2.	Call group_group_collide in the draw handler to detect missile/rock collisions. Increment the score by the number 
of missile collisions.

Phase five - Finish it off

You now have a mostly working version of RiceRocks!!! Let us add a few final touches.
1.	Add code to the draw handler such that, if the number of lives becomes 0, the game is reset, and the splash screen appears.
In particular,  set the flag started to False, destroy all rocks and prevent any more rocks for spawning until the
game is restarted.
2.When the game starts/restarts, make sure the lives and the score are properly initialized. Start spawning rocks.
Play/restart the background music loaded in the variable soundtrack in the program template.
3.When you spawn rocks, you want to make sure they are some distance away from the ship. Otherwise, you can die when
a rock spawns on top of you, which isn't much fun. One simple way to achieve this effect to ignore a rock spawn event if the spawned
rock is too close to the ship.
4.	Experiment with varying the velocity of rocks based on the score to make game play more difficult as the game progresses.
5.	Tweak any constants that you have to make the game play the way you want.
Congratulations! You have completed the assignment. Enjoy playing your game!!!

Bonus
The following will not be graded. Feel free to try this, but do not break any of the other game functionality. We strongly recommend 
that you save your work before doing this and keep track of it, so you can submit a working version of the first five phases if you
end up breaking your game trying to add more features.

One thing that is missing in your game is explosions when things collide. We have provided a tiled explosion image that you can use 
to create animated explosions. To get things working, you will need to do a few things:
1. In the draw method of the Sprite class, check if self.animated is True. If so, then choose the correct tile in the image based
on the age. The image is tiled horizontally. If self.animated is False, it should continue to draw the sprite as before.
2. Create an explosion_group global variable and initialize it to an empty set.
3. In group_collide, if there is a collision, create a new explosion (an instance of the Sprite class) and add it to the
explosion_group. Make sure that each explosion plays the explosion sound.
4. In the draw handler, use process_sprite_group to process explosion_group.
You should now have explosions working!
